## The goal of this project is to build a fraud detection model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in financial data using machine learning algorithms. Fraudulent transactions can be a major concern for financial institutions, leading to significant financial losses and reputational damage. Therefore, it is essential to have a robust fraud detection system in place to identify and prevent such transactions.
